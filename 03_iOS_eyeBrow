Test Case: iOS Accessibility - Cerebral Palsy User with Eyebrow Switch Control

**Objective:** To verify the effectiveness of the Switch Control accessibility feature on an iOS device for a user with cerebral palsy, utilizing eyebrow movement as the switch input method.

**Preconditions:**
1. An iOS device with the latest software version is available.
2. Switch Control is enabled in Settings > Accessibility > Switch Control.
3. Eyebrow movement has been configured as the switch input method.

**Test Steps:**

1. **Eyebrow Activation:**
   - Ensure that the user's eyebrow movement has been properly calibrated and configured as the switch input method in Switch Control settings.
   - Trigger the eyebrow-based switch activation.
   - Verify that the Switch Control overlay menu appears on the screen.

2. **Navigate Through Items:**
   - Use the eyebrow movement to navigate through on-screen items.
   - Verify that the currently highlighted item is indicated visually and audibly.
   - Ensure that the item navigation follows the selected scanning style (e.g., auto, manual).

3. **Select an Item:**
   - Navigate to an actionable item using eyebrow-based switch control.
   - Use the eyebrow activation to select the item.
   - Verify that the selected item responds as expected (e.g., opens, performs an action).

4. **Perform Action:**
   - Select an item that triggers an action (e.g., "Tap") using the eyebrow-based switch.
   - Use the eyebrow activation to perform the action.
   - Verify that the action is executed correctly (e.g., the app opens, a button is tapped).

5. **Scrolling:**
   - Open an app or screen with scrollable content (e.g., a webpage, list).
   - Use the eyebrow-based switch to scroll through the content.
   - Verify that the content scrolls in the expected direction and at a controllable speed.

6. **Custom Gestures:**
   - Configure a custom gesture in Switch Control settings.
   - Navigate to an item where the custom gesture is applicable.
   - Use the eyebrow-based switch to trigger the custom gesture.
   - Verify that the gesture is executed correctly and the desired action is performed.

7. **Multi-Step Actions:**
   - Test multi-step actions that require sequential selections (e.g., typing a message) using the eyebrow-based switch.
   - Use the switch to navigate through each step of the action.
   - Verify that the sequence of selections is accurate and leads to the intended outcome.

8. **Return to Home Screen:**
   - Navigate to the home screen using the eyebrow-based switch.
   - Verify that the home screen is accessible and items can be selected as expected.

9. **App Switching:**
   - Navigate between open apps using the eyebrow-based switch.
   - Verify that the app switcher is accessible and app selection works as intended.

**Postconditions:**
Switch Control accessibility feature using eyebrow movement has been thoroughly tested and verified for its functionality with the user's input method.

**Notes:**
- Sensitivity settings for the eyebrow-based switch should be adjusted to match the user's comfort and control.
- Document any challenges or issues encountered during testing and report them as needed.
