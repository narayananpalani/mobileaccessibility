Test Case: Android Device Accessibility Test using Color and Motion

**Test Case ID:** ADACM-001  
**Test Case Title:** Android Device Accessibility Test using Color and Motion

**Objective:** To verify the accessibility features of an Android device by testing the functionality of color and motion-based accessibility settings.

**Preconditions:**
1. An Android device with the latest software update is available.
2. Accessibility features are enabled in the device's settings.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Access Accessibility Settings

1. Open the "Settings" app on the Android device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "Accessibility".

**Expected Result:** The Accessibility settings screen should open.

**Step 2:** Test Color Correction

1. Inside the Accessibility settings, locate and tap on "Display & Text Size" or "Display".
2. Find the option for "Color correction" or "Color enhancement".
3. Toggle on the color correction feature if it's not already enabled.

**Expected Result:** Color correction should be enabled, adjusting colors on the screen for improved visibility.

**Step 3:** Verify Color Correction Variants

1. Under the color correction settings, find different options for color variants, such as "Grayscale", "Inverted", "Colorblindness", etc.
2. Select one of the color correction variants.
3. Use the device to navigate through different apps and interfaces.

**Expected Result:** The selected color correction variant should be applied consistently across different apps and interfaces.

**Step 4:** Test Reduce Motion

1. Return to the Accessibility settings.
2. Find and tap on "Motion & Interaction" or "Motion".
3. Enable the "Reduce motion" option.

**Expected Result:** Motion effects should be reduced or disabled, making the device interface less visually overwhelming.

**Step 5:** Verify Motion Reduction Effects

1. With "Reduce motion" enabled, navigate through the device's interface.
2. Open apps, switch between screens, and perform different interactions.

**Expected Result:** Motion effects, such as parallax scrolling and animations, should be minimized or absent in the interface.

**Step 6:** Test Display Size Adjustment

1. Return to the Accessibility settings.
2. Find the option to adjust "Display size" or "Text size".
3. Modify the display size to a larger or smaller value.

**Expected Result:** The display size adjustment should affect the size of text and UI elements across the device's interface.

**Step 7:** Verify Display Size Effects

1. With the display size adjusted, navigate through various apps and content.
2. Observe how text and UI elements scale in relation to the chosen display size.

**Expected Result:** Display size adjustments should consistently affect the size of text and UI elements throughout different apps.

**Step 8:** Reset Accessibility Settings

1. Return to the Accessibility settings.
2. Reset any color correction, motion reduction, or display size adjustments made during testing to their default settings.

**Expected Result:** Accessibility settings should be reverted to their default values.

**Postconditions:**
1. Android device accessibility using color and motion-related settings has been successfully tested.
2. Any issues or discrepancies encountered during testing are documented.

**Notes:**
- It's important to test color correction and motion reduction effects in various apps and interfaces to ensure consistent results.
- Some settings and options may vary based on the Android version and device manufacturer.
